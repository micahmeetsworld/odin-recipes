    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This chicken with creamy mushroom sauce recipe is a healthy and dairy-free option to get that cream sauce over pasta flavor with real food ingredients. With a rich and creamy sauce flavored with bacon, onion, mushrooms and garlic, you won’t believe it’s Paleo, Whole30 and dairy-free.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>5 slices bacon, diced</li>
        <li>3 boneless skinless chicken breasts, chopped into small cubes</li>
        <li>1/2 onion, diced</li>
        <li>2 cups mushrooms, sliced</li>
        <li>2 tbsp minced garlic</li>
        <li>1 cup coconut milk</li>
        <li>2 tbsp arrowroot flour</li>
        <li>1 tsp salt</li>
        <li>1 tsp pepper</li>
        <li>3 small zucchinis spiralized</li>
        <li>Chopped parsley for topping, (optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Cut up bacon and chicken breasts. Chop onions, mushrooms and mince garlic.</li> 
        <li>Heat a large skillet over medium heat. Once hot, add in the bacon to cook. Cook until it is just starting to get crispy, about 5-6 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon to a paper towel lined plate.</li>
        <li>While bacon is cooking, make your zoodles with the spiralizer and set aside. Add arrowroot starch to the coconut milk and mix well.</li>
        <li>Leaving at least 1 Tbsp bacon grease in the pan, add in the chicken to cook. Season the chicken with salt and pepper, about 1/2 tsp each. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the chicken cubes are white and cooked through, about 6-7 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove the cooked chicken from the pan and place on a plate.</li>
        <li>Next, add in the onion. Cook for 2-3 minutes, stirring occasionally and scraping up the chicken and bacon bits from the bottom of the pan.</li>
        <li>Add in the garlic and mushrooms. Cook, stirring frequently, for another 2-3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Mix up the coconut milk and arrowroot starch again. Add in the coconut milk to the pan, stirring constantly for 2 minutes. The sauce will thicken and bubble, that's ok.</li>
        <li>Finally, add the chicken and bacon back into the pan. Turn the heat down to low and simmer for about 2-3 minutes, stirring frequently.</li>
        <li>Place another pan over medium heat to warm up the zoodles. Place the zoodles in the pan to heat up for about 2-3 minutes, tossing every minute or so. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Alternatively, you can just add the zoodles in with the chicken mixture and stir to coat and cook until warmed through.</li>
        <li>Serve the chicken mixture over zoodles. Top with optional parsley and enjoy.</li>
    </ol>
